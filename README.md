# MAIC Website

This is the source code for the MSOE AI Club (MAIC) website. It is a modern React application built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and TypeScript.

This documentation is designed to help developers of all experience levels set up, run, and maintain the website.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your computer:

1.  **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime. We recommend the latest LTS version (v20+).  
    [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2.  **Git**: Version control system to manage the code.  
    [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)
3.  **Code Editor**: We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Git Bash) and run:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MSOE-AI-Club/maic-website.git
    cd maic-website
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    This downloads all the necessary libraries specified in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    _(Note: If you use `bun`, you can run `bun install` instead.)_

3.  **Setup Environment Variables**:
    The application relies on environment variables for configuration (like API content URLs).
    1.  Copy the example environment file:
        - **Windows**: Copy `.example.env` and rename it to `.env`.
        - **Mac/Linux**: `cp .example.env .env`
    2.  Open `.env` in your text editor. It should look like this:
        ```bash
        VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL=/content
        VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=
        VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://us.i.posthog.com
        VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
        ```

        > **Note**: Older versions of the project used a `VITE_BRANCH` environment variable. This is now legacy/unused and does not need to be set in new `.env` files.
    3.  **Important**: You will need to obtain the `VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` (for analytics) from a team lead or the project administrator.

        > **Note**: Clerk authentication (`VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`) is currently disabled in the codebase. You can leave this blank unless authentication is re-enabled.

### Running the Application

#### `npm run dev` — Day-to-day development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Use this whenever you are **writing or editing code**. Vite compiles on-the-fly and the browser reloads automatically every time you save a file. The terminal will show a URL (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).

- No build step needed — just run and start coding.
- Proxies `/content` to `http://localhost:8000` if `VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL=/content` is set in `.env`.

#### `npm run build` — Compile for production

```bash
npm run build
```

Use this when you are **done with your changes and want to produce a deployable bundle**. It compiles and optimizes everything into the `dist/` folder. You do not browse the site directly from this command — use `npm run preview` after.

- Run this before `npm run preview`.
- This is also what the CI/CD pipeline runs when deploying to GitHub Pages.

#### `npm run preview` — Test the production build locally

```bash
npm run build && npm run preview
```

Use this when you want to **verify your changes behave correctly in a production-like environment** before pushing. It serves the already-built `dist/` folder — it does not recompile on save.

- Always run `npm run build` first, otherwise you are previewing a stale build.
- Like `npm run dev`, it proxies `/content` to `http://localhost:8000` when `VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL=/content` is set.
- If you just want to quickly check against the live CDN, comment out `VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL` in `.env` before building (no local content server needed).

## 🧩 Key Concepts & Architecture

### The Content Hook (`github-hook.ts`)

A unique feature of this website is that it **fetches its content dynamically** from a separate repository (`maic-content`). This allows non-developers to update website text/images without touching the website code.

- **How it works**:
  The `github-hook.ts` file contains logic to fetch a `manifest.json` file from a remote URL (the Content CDN). This manifest lists all available markdown files and images. The website then uses this list to display articles, tutorials, or other content.

- **Configuration**:
  The hook resolves the content URL in this order:
  1.  `VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL` from your `.env` file (if set).
  2.  Default CDN: `https://msoe-ai-club.github.io/maic-content/`
  3.  Fallback: `/maic-content` (useful when content repository is a sibling folder).

  **Pointing to the production CDN (recommended for most development)**:
  Comment out or remove `VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL` in your `.env` file:
  ```bash
  # VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL=/content
  ```
  The hook will automatically fetch from `https://msoe-ai-club.github.io/maic-content/`. This works for both `npm run dev` and `npm run preview` with no extra setup.

  **Pointing to a local `maic-content` folder**:
  Keep `VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL=/content` in `.env` and start a local content server on port 8000 from inside the `maic-content` directory:
  ```bash
  cd ../maic-content
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```
  The proxy in `vite.config.ts` forwards all `/content` requests to `http://localhost:8000` for both `npm run dev` and `npm run preview`, so content edits are reflected immediately without deploying to GitHub Pages.

### Styling

We use **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling via the `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin. Instead of writing traditional CSS files, we use utility classes directly in the JSX code (e.g., `className="text-center text-blue-500"`). Global styles are defined in `src/index.css`.

- Docs: [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### Routing

We use **React Router** to handle navigation. New pages are defined in `src/App.tsx` (or wherever the Router is defined) and the page components live in `src/pages/`.

## 📦 Building for Production

When you are ready to deploy the website, you need to build a production version. This creates a highly optimized `dist/` folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

To test the production build locally before deploying:

```bash
npm run preview
```

> **Note**: `npm run preview` respects `VITE_CONTENT_BASE_URL` the same way `npm run dev` does. If it is set to `/content`, you need a local content server running on port 8000 (see the Content Hook section above). To test against the live CDN instead, comment the variable out in `.env` before building.

## 📚 Resources for New Developers

If you are new to React or Web Development, these resources will be helpful:

- **React**: [Official React Documentation](https://react.dev/learn) (Start here!)
- **TypeScript**: [TypeScript for React Developers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)

## 🤝 Development Process

1.  **Develop Locally**: Create a feature branch and develop your changes locally.
2.  **Merge to Dev**: Merge your feature branch into the `dev` branch.
3.  **Test Staging**: Test your changes on [dev.msoe-maic.com](https://dev.msoe-maic.com).
4.  **Merge to Main**: Once verified, merge `dev` into `main` to deploy to production.
